## Story Pitch

### Story Summary

While SNAP benefits remain relatively stagnant, costs for the program are growing. 

According to my analysis in Question 5, total benefits peaked in 2013, whereas additional costs have been growing steadily every year. This article will explore the reasoning behind this. The data source credits these other costs to "the Federal share of State administrative expenses, Nutrition Education, and Employment and Training programs." Why have these costs been growing disproportionately to the SNAP benefits given? The article will analyze changes from 2013 to 2019 in wages, training, education, and other expenses to answer the question.

### Data Sources

In addition to the two extra sources I used for my analysis (USA GDP and CPI) the following would be used for the article:

* __USA Poverty Data__
  * This source shows the yearly percentage of the United States' population in poverty; specifically, poverty in this dataset is labeled as those living on less than $1.90 per day.
  * This source is useful to the article because poverty likely correlates to the recipients of SNAP benefits. Therefore, a sharp rise in poverty from 2013 to 2019 may explain the need for higher costs.
  * Link: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=US

* __*Nutrition Reviews* Journal Article__
  * "Effect of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programâ€“Education (SNAP-Ed) on food security and dietary outcomes"
  *  The research demonstrated in this article shows how, despite SNAP's significant increase in food security, increases to nutrition as a result of the program still remain low.
  * This source is useful to the article because efforts to improve nutrition education may be the cause of increased cost.

## Questions

### 1. Are the total benefits proportional to the total cost over time?

To test whether the benefits are proportional to the total cost, I wanted to create a ratio for easier comparison over time.

__Step 1: Equation__ 
This was a simple equation (see below) that creates the ratio of benefits to costs. The resulting column shows how much of the total money spent goes into benefits. 

__Optional Step 2: % Format__
Optionally, you may change this format to percentage by clicking the % icon in the top left.

<img width="1139" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-05 at 1 58 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183166356-fdcaf2b6-f56c-4392-817c-fab462ebd3ac.png">

Because the numbers remain relatively constant (within hundreths of a decimal), I concluded that the benefits remained relatively proportional to the total cost.

### 2. Are the average benefits per person proportional to inflation prices (does the purchasing power remain constant)?

__Step 1: Download Data__ 
In order to compare the benefits to purchasing power, I had to download a dataset that shows these changes since the 1960s. I chose the Consumer Price Index because it best shows changes to prices relative to inflation.

<img width="1373" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 9 18 35 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183213295-0e7e0d48-e670-4fce-8a68-493aac3745e1.png">

__Step 2: Import and Sort__ 
After importing the data, I sorted it to only show statistics for the United States by using the filter option.

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 10 43 45 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183215316-bb2630e4-57ef-4c5b-b9d3-4167037a883d.png">

__Step 3: Copy and Paste__ 
After sorting the data, I copy and pasted the filtered values into another sheet.

<img width="947" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 10 49 45 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183215897-c1e3c718-f14d-4904-aa75-5f281a3d2011.png">

__Step 4: Transpose__ 
Then I used the 'transposed' option to paste the values with the years listed as columns.

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 10 44 42 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183216134-cffe5aac-ce7a-4a8e-a4a2-41a05f38b827.png">

__Step 5: Equation__ 
To combine this new dataset with the larger SNAP sheet, I used the VLOOKUP equation.

<img width="376" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 9 11 15 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183356539-beaa0041-a7ba-45bd-8c7b-99a880f2cea1.png">

__Step 6: Visualization__ 
The data by itself was difficult to interpret, so the best way to compare the benefits to the purchasing price was a visual representation. I inputted the data of average benefit per person to the CPI on a line graph.

[<img width="878" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 10 18 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183217526-66adb0ba-e592-4cc1-b34f-6b657f66186d.png">](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WVTIA/1/)

I concluded that the purchasing power of the SNAP benefits remained relatively constant given the line charts' similarity, with the value a bit lower in the beginning years than the latter years.

### 3. Were benefits affected by changes in the market (aka recessions)?

The process with which I completed this question is very similar to that of the previous one. 

__Step 1: Download Data__ 
First, I found a dataset of changes to the USA's GDP since the 1960s. I chose GDP changes rather than a more linear chart of the GDP over time because the prior source has more easily-identifiable recession periods.

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 9 06 55 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183310322-995d61cc-fbce-4324-ac71-db9563b72d88.png">

__Steps 2-4: Import, Sort Transpose (See Question 2)__ 
After downloading the data as a CSV, I imported it into my google sheet and copied, pasted and transposed it until it was in a simpler format (see steps 2 through 4 for Question 2 for step-by-step process).

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-02 at 3 49 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183310508-fb79248e-b0eb-4cbb-ab25-bbdd8e95900b.png">

__Step 5: Equation__ 
From there, I used a VLOOKUP equation to match this data with the larger SNAP dataset.

<img width="279" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 9 13 23 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183310309-06a5f924-8593-474e-8a50-23a54c56e637.png">

__Step 6: Visualization__ 
From there, I felt the best way to comprehend any correlation between recession and benefits was to use a data visualization. I used Datawrapper to create a line chart with shaded columns to represent recession years. Other than just dips in the GDP changes, I used a list of recessions from CNBC to confirm the years.

<img width="1329" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-07 at 1 44 17 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183310346-f475a610-e0cc-4896-b202-b6a0c9d22c49.png">

[<img width="838" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-05 at 1 40 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183310264-e425d7b5-3925-4621-a2c1-1ec9c746b1c3.png">](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WOm5a/1/)

From analyzing this chart, I concluded that there was little to no effect of the GDP on SNAP benefits in general, except for the Great Recession (2007 to 2009), during which there was a sharp increase of the average benefit per person.

### 4. Which decade had the most SNAP participants (of the decades provided)?

First, I had to organize the data by decade. There are several ways to do this, so this is just one method.

__Step 1: Equation__ 
I used the ROUNDDOWN to round down the years to the most recent decade.

<img width="220" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-07 at 10 38 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183349106-de9f395b-43af-4343-9174-34e00ff44d26.png">

The above funtion's syntax is ROUNDDOWN(value, places). Here is the breakdown for this example:
ROUNDDOWN(A4*0.1,0)*10
  * A is the column with contains the years. We are on row 4 in this example.
  * Multiplying the value by 0.1 turns the format from thousands to hundreds.
    * Ex: 1969 becomes 196.9
  * Having a 0 in  'places' rounds down the value to the whole number.
    * EX: 196.9 becomes 196
  * Multiplying the whole equation by 10 returns the numbers to four digits -- their decade.
    * Ex: 196 becomes 1960

__Step 2: Pivot Table__ 
From there, I made a pivot table to analyze the data.

<img width="322" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-07 at 10 46 07 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183351370-7fdf4a5f-873c-4ccb-b14c-6c119a8352cc.png">

__Step 3: Format Table__ 
I then formatted the pivot table to show the participation by decade.

<img width="460" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-07 at 10 49 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183351656-735a999c-b1fd-4c6d-abc2-10d13d63b34e.png">

__Step 4: Format Decades__ 
Because the 1960s only have one year (1969), I filtered this decade out to only have the fully complete decades shown.

<img width="323" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-07 at 10 42 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183351920-d4c0451a-1b6d-41cf-acfc-860670465b58.png">

From there, I was able to analyze the data and conclude that the total participants grew every decade, making the 2010s the decade with the highest number of participants.

<img width="306" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-07 at 10 49 43 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183352206-74b2eddc-f5d7-4b6c-835e-69b966538436.png">

### 5. Which year had the highest total benefits? Highest other costs?

__Steps 1-2: Sort for Each Column__ 
This is a relatively simple process. For this question, I simply sorted the total benefit column by descending value and scrolled over to the top year. Then I did the same for other costs.

<img width="462" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-07 at 11 30 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619721/183354520-43043b81-9817-4a50-ba53-97d36ca10d4f.png">

I found that 2013 had the most total benefits but did not, in fact, have the highest cost for other variables. Instead, 2019 had the highest costs other than benefits.
