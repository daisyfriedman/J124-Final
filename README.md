# J124-Final

## Questions

### 1. Are the total benefits proportional to the total cost over time?

##### To test whether the benefits are proportional to the total cost, I wanted to create a ratio for easier comparison over time.

##### This was a simple equation (seen above). The resulting column did shows how much of the total money spent goes into benefits (see highlighted column in image below).

##### Because the numbers remain relatively constant (within hundreths of a decimal), I concluded that the benefits remained relatively proportional to the total cost.

### 2. Are the average benefits per person proportional to inflation prices (does the purchasing power remain constant)?

##### In order to compare the benefits to purchasing power, I had to download a dataset that shows these changes since the 1960s. I chose the Consumer Price Index because it best shows changes to prices relative to inflation.

After importing the data, I sorted it to only show statistics for the United States by using the filter option.

After sorting the data, I copy and pasted the filtered values into another sheet.

Then I used the 'transposed' option to paste the values with the years listed as columns.

To combine this new dataset with the larger SNAP sheet, I used the VLOOKUP equation.

The data by itself was difficult to interpret, so the best way to compare the benefits to the purchasing price was a visual representation. I inputted the data of average benefit per person to the CPI on a line graph.

### 3. Were benefits affected by changes in the market (aka recessions)?
